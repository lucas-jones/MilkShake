Haxe Game Engine

  * Multiplayer (Local & Remote) - Try keep decoupled
  * SplitScreen
  * TileMaps
  * SpriteSheets (AutoGenerated via Grunt)
  * XML GameObject tempate (Smart Autocomplete)
  * Basic collision
  * Preloading assets
  * Masks?
  * Animation (Frame by Frame & Spriter)
  * Particles (Flint?)
  * Physics (Nape)
  * Tweens (Use a library?)
  * Polygon helpers (Think of Ra + GiftWrapping / Water)
  * Filters (PixiJS) (2D Lighting)
  * 3DStage (Three.JS - How would work together with Pixi)
  * Input (Mouse, Keyboard, Touch, GamePad)
  * Audio?
  * Timeline (Events eg. Cutscenes)  

 Having a NetGameObject
 Which can be serialized easy. Imagine entering a multiplayer mid-game.
 Server -> Client EntireState, Then updates from then on?

 You would declate how a GameObject is serialized
  
  Creates meta data tag for reflection. Variables with the sync meta tag get serialised to
  the specified protocol and synced behind the scenes. Each instance of the class is assigned a
  GUID so that it can be correctly synced across all clients.
  @networkObject("sceneObject", JsonPacketHandler)
  class Scene extends DisplayObject
  {

    This variable will be synced as soon as it is set.
    @sync(UpdateRate.High)
    private var x:Int;


  Entity
  [
    new NetVar("position", UpdateRate.HIGH),
     or
    new NetVar("x", UpdateRate.HIGH),
    new NetVar("y", UpdateRate.HIGH),
  ]

  GameObject:
  [
    new NetVar("width", UpdateRate.HIGH),
    new NetVar("height", UpdateRate.HIGH),
    new NetVar("scale", UpdateRate.LOW),  SmoothTween
  ]

  Will store last sent state, and look through all NetVar for changes
  


 Network with different protocols

 new JsonPacketHandler()
 new BinaryPacketHandler()
 new BsonPacketHandler()

 AddHandler auto cast obv


 The cameras are a diplayObject of the stage. the scene are not.
 stage.AddChild(SceneManager) SceneManager shouldn't add scenes to displayTree, should add cameras.
